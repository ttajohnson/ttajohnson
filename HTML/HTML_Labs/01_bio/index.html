        <p>William John Evans was an American jazz pianist and composer who worked primarily as the leader of his trio. 
            His use of impressionist harmony, interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords, and trademark 
            rhythmically independent, "singing" melodic lines continues to influence jazz pianists today.

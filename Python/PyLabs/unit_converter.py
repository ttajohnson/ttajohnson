# LAB 01: UNIT CONVERTER
# This lab will involve writing a program that allows the user to convert a
# number between units.

# VERSION 1
# Ask the user for the number of feet, and print out the equivalent distance in
# meters. Hint: 1 ft is 0.3048 m. So we can get the output in meters by
# multiplying the input distance by 0.3048.
